# OsoShift: Oso Landslide Story
A compelling 3D animation simulating the sequence and spatial extent of the catastrophic mudslide at Steelhead Haven near Oso, WA, vividly illustrating the event's impact and aftermath. It integratess terrain data, pre- and post- event imagery, and animation timelines to vividly depict the mudslide's progression, impact on infrastructure, and environmental aftermath-enhacing preparedness and public awareness.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ArcGIS Pro

I began by downloading the files needed to build the 3D map scene and create the animation. My first step was to establish a starting keyframe, using a built-in bookmark to set the initial position. I configured the export settings to GIF for optimal viewing, ensuring the animation would be clear and engaging. Then, I moved on to adding additional keyframes, each designed to capture different angles of the mudslide—before and after—highlighting the scale of the destruction. I relied on bookmarks to precisely position each view, making sure every angle contributed to a comprehensive presentation.

To create smooth transitions between the before and after images, I carefully adjusted transparency settings, turning layers on and off at just the right moments to maintain clarity and flow. Each transition was crafted to ensure the viewer could easily understand the changes over time. To further aid comprehension, I added text overlays that explained the visual information being presented, providing context to the unfolding scene.

After aligning all the elements and perfecting the transitions, I exported the animation. The final product was a powerful visual representation of the mudslide's impact—effectively capturing its scale and conveying the story of the destruction with clarity and impact.

## Lessons Learned:

I embarked on the animation project expecting a straightforward process, but I quickly learned how intricate it truly was. Initially, I thought it would simply involve inserting a few frames. However, the transition between the before and after scenes proved complex, requiring careful adjustment of layers and transparency to ensure a smooth change.

This challenge taught me valuable lessons about positioning, perspective, and creative problem-solving. It opened my eyes to the nuances of animation, helping me develop a keen attention to detail and learn how to manipulate elements to effectively communicate the story. By the end, I had gained a deeper appreciation for the art of animation and the skill required to create a seamless, engaging narrative.
