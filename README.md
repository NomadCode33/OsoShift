## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ArcGIS Pro

I began by downloading the necessary files to construct the 3D map scene and create the animation. My first task was to establish the initial keyframe using a built-in bookmark to set the starting position. With the export settings configured to GIF for optimal viewing, I moved on to adding additional keyframes. These keyframes showcased various angles of the mudslide, including before and after images, to effectively depict the extent of the destruction. Bookmarks were used to accurately position each view, ensuring a comprehensive presentation.

To create seamless transitions between the before and after images of the mountain, I meticulously adjusted transparency settings. This involved carefully turning layers on and off at precise moments to maintain consistency and clarity. To further aid viewer comprehension, I added text overlays that explained the visual information being presented. 

Finally, after ensuring all elements were perfectly aligned and the transitions were smooth, I exported the animation. The result was a powerful and clear visual representation of the mudslide's impact, effectively communicating the scale of the destruction.

## Lessons Learned:

I embarked on the animation project expecting a straightforward process, but I quickly learned how intricate it truly was. Initially, I thought it would simply involve inserting a few frames. However, the transition between the before and after scenes proved complex, requiring careful adjustment of layers and transparency to ensure a smooth change.

This challenge taught me valuable lessons about positioning, perspective, and creative problem-solving. It opened my eyes to the nuances of animation, helping me develop a keen attention to detail and learn how to manipulate elements to effectively communicate the story. By the end, I had gained a deeper appreciation for the art of animation and the skill required to create a seamless, engaging narrative.
