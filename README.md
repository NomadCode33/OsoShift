## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ArcGIS Pro

I began by downloading the necessary files to construct the 3D map scene and create the animation. My first task was to establish the initial keyframe using a built-in bookmark to set the starting position. With the export settings configured to GIF for optimal viewing, I moved on to adding additional keyframes. These keyframes showcased various angles of the mudslide, including before and after images, to effectively depict the extent of the destruction. Bookmarks were used to accurately position each view, ensuring a comprehensive presentation.

To create seamless transitions between the before and after images of the mountain, I meticulously adjusted transparency settings. This involved carefully turning layers on and off at precise moments to maintain consistency and clarity. To further aid viewer comprehension, I added text overlays that explained the visual information being presented. 

Finally, after ensuring all elements were perfectly aligned and the transitions were smooth, I exported the animation. The result was a powerful and clear visual representation of the mudslide's impact, effectively communicating the scale of the destruction.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
